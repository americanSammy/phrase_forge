# Phrase Forge
A simple app to show your top used words in your iMessage chat.db file to create a vocab list to customize foreign language learning.

By knowing ~300-1500 words in your target language, you are well on your way to a level of fluency to be proud of!
Great lists exist online, but I looked at many of them and never found them to fit my conversational needs.
Together with Daddy ChatGPT, I created this little Python app to take my chat.db file from my Mac and run a simple word frequency count analysis to show me my top 300 words.

*To Dos:*
- Add support for WhatsApp chat files
- Make the GUI more pleasing
- Connect with Translation APIs to get the words more quickly
- Make the list exportable as a .csv
- Create a more visually interesting Bubble chart
